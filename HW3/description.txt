Problem 1 - My approach follows the structured approach given in the problem: first, it opens the binary files and reads the matrix dimensions, ensuring they are compatible. If they are not, the program exits with an error message. The matrices are then read into 3D arrays using `fread`, leveraging row-major order for efficient storage and retrieval. A nested loop structure performs element-wise multiplication, storing the results in a separate 3D array. Finally, the result matrix is written back to a new binary file, maintaining the same format.

Problem 2 - The approach to solving this problem involves recursively traversing the given directory using `opendir()` and `readdir()` to process all files and subdirectories. For each entry, the program checks whether it's a directory or a regular file using `stat()`. If it's a directory, the function calls itself recursively to continue traversing. If it's a `.txt` file, the program opens it using `fopen()`, reads through its contents, and counts the number of newline characters to determine the line count. The total line count is accumulated and displayed after traversal is complete. The use of recursion ensures that all nested directories are processed efficiently.
